function Remove-RSReservedURL
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Removes a URL reserved for the report server. If there are multiple URLs that need to be removed, this must be done one by one calling this API.
.EXAMPLE
Remove-RSReservedURL -Application ReportManager -UrlString 'http://+:80'
.EXAMPLE
 
.NOTES
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb630596(v=sql.110).aspx
RemoveURL(
    System.String Application, 
    System.String UrlString, 
    System.Int32 Lcid
)

UrlString does not include the Virtual Directory name ??? the Set-RSVirtualDirectory Method (WMI MSReportServer_ConfigurationSetting) method is provided for that purpose.

Before calling the ReserveURL method, you must supply a value for the VirtualDirectory configuration property for the Application parameter. Use the Set-RSVirtualDirectory Method (WMI MSReportServer_ConfigurationSetting) method to set the VirtualDirectory property.

If an SSL Certificate was provisioned by Reporting Services and no other URLs need it, it is removed.

This method causes all non-configuration app domains to hard recycle and stop during this operation; app domains are restarted after this operation complete.
